This code will prompt the user to enter the password for the PDF file, open the PDF file, decrypt it with the user-provided password, and extract any Excel files that are embedded in the PDF. The Excel files will be written to the current directory with their original filenames.

Note that this code assumes that the user knows the password for the PDF file. If the user does not know the password, they will not be able to decrypt the PDF and extract the embedded Excel files.
